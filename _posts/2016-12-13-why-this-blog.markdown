The main purpose of this blog is to share with the world any new or interesting
thing I will learn or encounter. In this process, I also hope to improve my writing skills. The blog will mainly contain posts related to web-development and programming. Ocassionaly I may post non-tech related stuff such as rants, philosophical stuff, movie reviews and other things.

I aim to update this blog weekly. Hoping to meet you soon in my next blog post.
